## Footballer transfer fee prediction
I extracted the data of 1,700 footballer  and developed the "footballer transfer fee prediction â€‹project with machine learning" using the data of these players.
In this project, you can learn footballer transfer fee by entering features of footballer to interface in current transfer market. I used the 2019 and 2020 data because 2020 and 2021 seasons are not yet over0 season



## You can watch the details of the project on my youtube channel
